# Title: Pokemon classification on iOS using Convolutional Neural Network based on Keras

---

## Idea: 

**I want my project to be able to recognise Pokemon in a live camera stream using the camera on my iOS mobile device such as iPhone**



---

## Data:
I collect hand-cropped and labeled Pokemon images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) for Pokemon classification. Noticing that this dataset is unbalanced - 9 classes have a lot of pictures, while other classes have few images. Therefore, only 5 classes with most number of images are selected after sorting 'count' for each class.
